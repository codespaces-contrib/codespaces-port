# Codespaces Port

If you're developing within a GitHub Codespace, and would like to retrieve the URL of a forwarded port, then simply run the following command, specifying the port number that you'd like to retrieve the URL for:

`npx -q codespaces-port <port>`

> The `-q` flag simply suppresses `npx` logging, and therefore, isn't strictly necessary.
